# Wylo Assignment - Responsive Post Management App

This ReactJS application allows users to create, edit, and view posts. It utilizes Redux for state management and React Router for navigation.

**Features:**

- **Create Posts:** Users can submit a title and content to create new posts.
- **Edit Posts:** Users can edit the title and content of existing posts.
- **Posts List:** All posts are displayed in a responsive layout.
- **Edit Button:** Each post has an "Edit" button for easy editing.
- **Responsive Design:** The application adapts to different screen sizes.

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3. Start the development server: `npm start` (or `yarn start`)

**Usage:**

1. Open http://localhost:3000 (or your development server port) in a browser.
2. You'll see a list of existing posts (initially empty).
3. Click the "Create Post" button to create a new post.
4. Edit existing posts using the "Edit" button on each post.

**Deployment:**

(Instructions will vary depending on your chosen deployment platform. Here's a general outline.)

1. Build the production-ready version of the application: `npm run build` (or `yarn build`)
2. Follow the deployment steps provided by your chosen platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Heroku).
3. Update the `README.md` with the deployment link.

**Technologies Used:**

- ReactJS
- Redux
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS (optional)

**Improvements:**

- **CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete):** Consider implementing post deletion functionality for an enhanced user experience.
- **Form Validation:** Integrate basic form validation to ensure required fields are filled before creating or editing posts.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully display messages in case of issues with post creation, editing, or data retrieval.
- **Authentication and Authorization (Optional):** For advanced scenarios, consider introducing user authentication and authorization to allow only authorized users to create and edit posts.

**Additional Notes:**

- Replace placeholders with your actual Redux actions and reducers.
- Adjust styling and layout as desired using Tailwind CSS or other preferred methods.
- Remember to test your application thoroughly to ensure functionality and responsiveness.
